			be Primitive.NULL

		@param fromValue an Object or bsh.Primitive primitive value (including
			Primitive.NULL or Primitive.VOID )

		@param checkOnly If checkOnly is true then fromValue must be null.
			FromType is checked for the cast to toType...
			If checkOnly is false then fromValue must be non-null
			(Primitive.NULL is ok) and the actual cast is performed.

		@throws UtilEvalError on invalid assignment (when operation is
			assignment ).

		@throws UtilTargetError wrapping ClassCastException on cast error 
			(when operation is cast)

		@param operation is Types.CAST or Types.ASSIGNMENT
