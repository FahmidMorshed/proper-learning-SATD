          First, some notes.
          On MRJ 2.2.2, getting the size, compressed size, and CRC32 from the
          ZipInputStream does not work for compressed (deflated) files.  Those calls return -1.
          For uncompressed (stored) files, those calls do work.
          However, using ZipFile.getEntries() works for both compressed and
          uncompressed files.

          Now, from some simple testing I did, it seems that the value of CRC-32 is
          independent of the compression setting. So, it should be easy to pass this
          information on to the output entry.
