               things in a rather complex way.

               (1) Move is optimized to move directories if a fileset
               has been included completely, therefore FileSets need a
               special treatment.  This is also required to support
               the failOnError semantice (skip filesets with broken
               basedir but handle the remaining collections).

               (2) We carry around a few protected methods that work
               on basedirs and arrays of names.  To optimize stuff, all
               resources with the same basedir get collected in
               separate lists and then each list is handled in one go.

          First, some notes.
          On MRJ 2.2.2, getting the size, compressed size, and CRC32 from the
          ZipInputStream does not work for compressed (deflated) files.  Those calls return -1.
          For uncompressed (stored) files, those calls do work.
          However, using ZipFile.getEntries() works for both compressed and
          uncompressed files.

          Now, from some simple testing I did, it seems that the value of CRC-32 is
          independent of the compression setting. So, it should be easy to pass this
          information on to the output entry.
