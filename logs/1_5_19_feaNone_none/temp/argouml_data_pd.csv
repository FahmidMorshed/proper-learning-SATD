 * MultiEditorPane. Added functionality:<p>
 *
 * Spawning: When the tab is double-clicked, this JPanel will generate a
 * separate window of the same size and with the same contents. This is almost
 * like ""tearing off"" a tab.<p>
 *
 * TODO: Spawning of windows disabled in spawn()<p>
 *
 * Title: This JPanel keeps track of its own title.<p>
 *
 * Icon: This JPanel keeps track of its own icon; i.e. an arrow pointing to
 * the panel that it gives details of.<p>
 *
 * Orientation: This JPanel is Orientable.<p>
 *
 * Cloning: This JPanel may be cloned.<p>
 *
 * This class used to be named TabSpawnable.
 * Renamed since it is not a Tab, but a Panel, and being spawnable is
 * not any more its main purpose.
